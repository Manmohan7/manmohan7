## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Manmohan. I was first introduced to web development in 2012 in high school which triggered my interest in coding so I decided to pursue Computer Science Engineering.

During my graduation, along with learning different languages, I enjoyed managing events during college fests and other miscellaneous occasions.
<br><br>
Entered the industry in 2017 and was amazed to see how things actually worked in real life coupled with each other.
<br><br>
Started the first job working as full stack web developer where I got the chance to work with a lot of technologies including jQuery, Angular, PHP, Python, MySQL, MongoDB.
<br><br>
After a while I realised my interest leaning more towards frontend development.
<br><br>
Fast forward to 2020, just before the Covid era, switched to a new organisation as a UI Developer. And here we are now, an enthusiastic UI developer who loves to explore new frameworks and emerging technologies.
<br><br>


### Things that helped me grow

* the eagerness to learn new stuff
* critical eye for user experience and interface.

### Interests

* recently discovered love for travelling and meeting new people
* definitely love for music.
