## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>Hi, my name is <span class="name">Manmohan</span>. I was first introduced to web development in 2012 in high school which triggered my interest in coding so I decided to pursue Computer Science Engineering.</p>
<img class="float-right" src="https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/abhisheknaiidu/blob/master/code.gif?raw=true" width="40%">
<p>During my graduation, along with learning different languages, I enjoyed managing events during college fests and other miscellaneous occasions.</p>
<p>Entered the industry in 2017 and was amazed to see how things actually worked in real life coupled with each other.</p>
<p>Started the first job working as full stack web developer where I got the chance to work with a lot of technologies including jQuery, Angular, PHP, Python, MySQL, MongoDB.</p>
<p>After a while I realised my interest leaning more towards frontend development.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020, just before the Covid era, switched to a new organisation as a UI Developer. And here we are now, an enthusiastic UI developer who loves to explore new frameworks and emerging technologies.<p>


### Things that helped me grow

* the eagerness to learn new stuff
* critical eye for user experience and interface.


### Interests

* recently discovered love for travelling and meeting new people
* definitely love for music.
